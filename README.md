# ReMod LJ
A slight fork of: ReMod Community Edition - A All-in-One VRChat mod to suit all your needs using [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader).

Mostly just removes features for more paranoid users and makes building on linux possible.

# Description
This is essentially a public version of RequiDev's invite-only VRChat mod. It's a cut-down version with no connection to the ReMod server and with it's security measures removed.  

If you want a feature or have a bug report, head over to the issues page and create an issue for it!

# Installation & Usage
Build the loader dll and put it in your Mods directory.  

By default the loader will attempt to load the mod from your VRChat directory using the filename 'ReModCE.dll'.

The loader has been stripped of automated updating features completely.
No builds will be provided, build from source.
If you are trusting enough for random .dll files, just use the original version.
